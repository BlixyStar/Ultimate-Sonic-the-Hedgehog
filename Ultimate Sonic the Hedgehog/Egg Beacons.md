Egg Beacons, also known as Goal Plates & Spinning Signs, are the network connection of the Zone with local groups of Badniks. They were created by Dr. Eggman to quickly transfer data & directives from Zone to Zone. Although, their flawed system allows outsiders to manipulate & disrupt the flow of the network by simply spinning the Beacon. The more specialized can even take over their signal and use local badniks as a way to restore the Zone from Eggman's influence.
