Red Gate Bay is a coastal part [[Red Valley City]]. It contains the part of the main road connecting it with other parts of the city. The side-roads of the bay contain dash pads & few corkscrews for Mobian folk to move around at higher speeds, than walking by the sidewalk. Between the buildings and tighter gaps where side-roads can't be placed, are located grind rails for more skilled acrobatics. As in the case of the rest of the city, the invention of such mobilization was formed after regaining freedom for [[The Resistance]] to get across the city quicker.
